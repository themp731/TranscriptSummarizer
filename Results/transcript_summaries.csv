Liquidity remains strong with $953 billion of global liquidity sources . commercial loans grew 3% year over year, and consumer lending grew modestly . we expect to start the year in the first quarter with NII modestly higher than the fourth . we expect that growth to increase through the year to the point where it could be 6% to 7% higher in 2025 than 2024 . interest rate expectations continue to drive volatility and predictability, but we'll provide some deposit levels grew to $870 billion over loans at the end of Q4 . a decrease of 100 basis points would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.3 billion . we reported $16.8 billion in expense this quarter . the order doesn't limit any of our growth plans . we expect the first quarter to include some normal seasonal elevation . net charge-offs of a little less than $1.5 billion improving modestly compared to the third quarter . consumer banking made nearly $11 billion or 40% of the company's earnings in 2024 . consumer banking continued to deliver strong organic growth with high-quality accounts . investment balances grew 22% to $518 billion with full year flows of $25 billion . in the fourth quarter of '23, we reported revenue of $6 billion, growing 15% over the prior year . about 30% of our revenue remains in net interest income, which complements fees earned in our advice model . expenses were up year over year, but they grew slower than revenue, creating leverage . for the year, record sales and trading results of nearly $19 billion grew 7% from 2023 . in the fourth quarter, earnings of $955 million grew 30% year over year . this is the first time we've recorded more than 4 billion in our results . we're looking for strong growth in NII, and we'll continue important investments in the franchise . we aren't expecting much movement around credit based on a pretty solid economic outlook . if you've got any questions, feel free to contact us at info@wolferesearch.com  consumer found its floor in August, wealth found its level in July . in Q2, we added $9 billion of loans, in Q3, we added $19 billion . we're still a beneficiary of the fixed asset repricing, which comes off in 2025 . revenue growth is going at twice that rate plus, and expense growth is growing . the business it's coming from is those businesses which have the quickest move relative to expense . revenue is growing faster than it might grow all the time in more normalized environments . if you look at the growth rate expense, about 45% NII kicks in, consumer business flattens out, revenue base broadens . if market goes up, it'll slow down to more normal growth rate, analyst says . headcount is easiest thing to think about, and that's been relatively stable . if we get the deposit growth we anticipate, do we think we'll use some of that to pay off some of the higher cost liabilities on the balance sheet? that's consistent with what we said in prior calls . as we grow the really high-quality parts of the deposit franchise, it allows us to take those down  analyst: we bought 3.5 billion shares in the past couple quarters . we earn the money, pay the dividend, invest in the growth of the business . analyst: ""we hope, you know, some relief in the volatility of the CCAR outcomes"" evercore is driving 11 straight quarters of year-over-year growth . the company has a zero-interest deposit base that provides a lot of leverage . analyst: ""when we see good environments like this, some companies tend to blow out numbers"" the fourth quarter was one of the highest we've ever had . we put another 10%-plus growth on top of it . if that plays out, does that change how we're thinking about consumer spending? n Schorr: we're following the Fed rate cuts, just repricing things accordingly . a lot of noninterest-bearing balances have bottomed out in the past two years . rotation is slowing, so that's factoring into our guidance, najarian says  a normalized net interest margin of 2.3% will be introduced over the course of 2024 . with a neutral rate, you know, maybe around 4%, can BofA get there more quickly? if the Fed funds rate stays higher, we'll get there faster . but we're carrying a larger markets balance sheet, which is a little less robust in that area . if it stays at a higher nominal rate, you'll see this adjustment come through . in any given quarter, we just don't have enough fixed rate assets repricing to drive NII . incoming treasury secretary said he would like to reinvigorate banks . ""if you had a level playing field, how much would your CET1 ratio increase?"" if we ever got to Europe, our numbers would be probably a big, a lot, lot higher . but just we, as a society, will have a more conservatively capitalized industry . if they were to take the volatility out of CCAR, how can it change so much of the scenario the company generated 1.1 million net new checking accounts in 4Q . customer service capabilities are scoring at the highest they've ever come . this is just a great job done, says seaport global's chief executive officer . bank of america is generating openings at twice the rate of young people exist in society for its customers . we entered a lot of markets over the last five years, you know, Denver, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Milwaukee now, Lexington, etc. but we still have lots of ways to grow  NIH is assuming a 5% to 6% growth in the S&P type of numbers in '25 . the company is also focusing on opex and generating capabilities . it's been a great year for NI, and we're excited about the future . BSBY hedges started to accrete this quarter . most of it will take place in 2025, then there'll be a little bit in 2026 and a tiny bit in '27 . analyst: we've got to get a set of rules that could move in around on us  if you have that extra 100 basis clients, you would do a little bit more in some areas . in a global banking business, if they get strong loan growth, there's nothing that we're slowing it down . if the consumer team had more credit card loan growth that was based on risk the balance sheet of equity prime brokerage is $300 billion larger than it was four, five years ago . if capital requirements are tweaked, it could make some businesses more profitable . ""i don't expect to see change in how we do it,"" says chairman and chief executive officer . credit quality for you and your peers has been very strong . we went from zero to plus 5% at the short end of the curve . consumer spending in the 3% to 4% range has been stronger than five years ago . we're glad to see three or four quarters now with some stability . unless there's a big change in the economy, we think we'll be around in this 50 to 60 basis points . we have wars and trade wars, etc., that bothers investors . top 30 institutions are doing stress testing to see if they're wrong in underwriting . that's going across a big portion of the banking industry . ""we worry about how much leverage is building up in the system that there'll be difficulties with"" small business optimism is up, and you've got a flat curve at the front end . the draw rates and lines of credit stuff are still much lower than they were in a pre-pandemic . but their optimism has changed, and that's really around the other things . bank of america is one of the few that actually has small business loan growth year on year .

Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? i think it makes a lot of sense to stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do a couple years from now people change their mind, have family circumstances . so, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure . a new administration coming in, we have a newly-to-be head of regulation at the Fed. john avlon: all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework . he says regulators need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine banking system . banks should be able to do their job, supporting the economy, he writes  Jeremy Barnum: ""let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world"" since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased . but we are not seeing any improvement in demand on lending, he says . if you print that score at the end of this year, your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now . in terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year' aaron carroll: we're happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed . he says it's as much as anything about preserving rights in light of statute of limitations deadlines . carroll says the numerator is a ton of excess, which is why we've cnn's john sutter asks: is it just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase? he says steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake .
